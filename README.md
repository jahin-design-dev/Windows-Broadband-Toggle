# Windows Broadband Toggle (.bat)

A lightweight Windows batch script that **automatically connects or disconnects** your broadband connection with a single double-click.

## ⚙️ How It Works
The script checks whether the connection named **"Broadband Connection"** is active.  
- If it's ON → it disconnects.  
- If it's OFF → it connects using your ISP ID and password.
